## Introduction
We welcome contributions via
[pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) filed against
[our repository](https://github.com/Open-Source-Compliance/Sharing-creates-value). A contribution can be code, bugfixes, documentation, presentation or any other content. 

In order to be clear - we will not accept any pull request which deals with proprietary tools. In case you are not sure what this means please check the README file in the root directory of this project.

## Signing each Commit


You can find the text of the [DCO here](https://developercertificate.org/ ) 

An example signed commit message:

```
    Data Structures: Add attributes to class xyz
    Signed-off-by: Cary Carlson <cary.carlson@someorg.org>
```

## Rules you should care about

We have defined only very few rules how your commits shall look like and how they shall be phrased:

  * Make separate commits for logically separate changes
  * Provide meaningful commit messages
  * Describe your changes well and in imperative
  * To resolve conflicts, rebase pull request branches onto their target branch 
 
If you want to learn more the git project provides very good documentation about [how to submit patches](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/SubmittingPatches)
