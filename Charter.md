* code and test cases

There is only one thing you shall be aware of the overall purpose of this project is to build an OSS compliance toolchain with open source tools. This means that we will not accept contributions, which might put a non open source tool into the toolchain.

 
 ## Decisions
 Decisions about the future of the project are made with the Developers through discussion with all members of the team who wish to participate in the discussion, from the newest Developers to the most experienced one. All project management discussion takes place in team meetings and on the oss-based-compliance-tooling@groups.io mailing list.
In order to ensure that the project is not blocked by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.

 
 ## License policy
