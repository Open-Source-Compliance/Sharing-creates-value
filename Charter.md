 ## Contributions
Contributions are the essential element of an open source project. No open source project will be successfull without contributions. Since contributions are fundamental we welcome contributions from all. Contributions mae documentation, case studies, website content, integration scenarios code and test cases are governed under the contributing guidelines, relevant licensing guidelines and terms of use of our website.
 
 Since the overall purpose of this project is to build an OSS compliance toolchain with open source tools we will not accept contributions, which might put a non open source tool into the toolchain.
 
 ## Decisions
 Decisions about the future of the project are made with the Developers through discussion with all members of the team who wish to participate in the discussion, from the newest Developers to the most experienced one. All project management discussion takes place in team meetings and on the oss-based-compliance-tooling@groups.io mailing list.
In order to ensure that the project is not blocked by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.

 
 ## License policy
 We follow a simple and clear approach in regard to licensing. All artifacts which are documentation are to be licensed under CC-BY-SA-4.0. All artifacts which are code (including tests) are licensed under MIT.
