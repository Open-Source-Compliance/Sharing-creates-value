## Structure
The most important thing about engaging with Sharing creates value is that everyone is equal. We welcome everybody to join the community of this project and to contribute to the project. Anyone can use the artifacts developed in this project in accordance to the licenses which are valid to the particular artifact.
 
## Contributions
Contributions are the essential element of an open source project. No open source project will be successfull without contributions. Since contributions are fundamental we welcome contributions from all. We are happy to receive contributions to
* documentation (epics, user stories, glossary, 
* data model (classes, attributes, associations, etc.)
* process flows
* case studies
* integration scenarios
* code and test cases
* website content
 
There is only one thing you shall be aware of the overall purpose of this project is to build an OSS compliance toolchain with open source tools. This means that we will not accept contributions, which might put a non open source tool into the toolchain.

 
## Decisions
Decisions about the future of the project are made with the community through discussion with all members ho wish to participate in the discussion, from the newest Developers to the most experienced one. All project management discussion takes place in meetings and on the oss-based-compliance-tooling@groups.io mailing list. The meeting invitations are send to the mailing list.

### How Decisions are taken

Our objective is to take consensus based decisions. We follow the model of [Lazy Consensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html) as defined by the [Apache Software Foundation](https://community.apache.org/) 

In cases where no consensus can be achieved and a decision is required we do explicit votings.

#### Consensus Building
Sometimes there is no obvious path to take. In these cases we need to build consensus by making proposals and eliciting responses.

We want to avoid unnecessary discussion and the creation of significant amounts of unnecessary mail that everyone in the community needs to read. That is not to say that we want to avoid constructive discussion. This is the lifeblood of a successful project. 

##### Expressing support (or otherwise)
First of all, it is important to understand that everyone is invited to express their opinion of any given action or proposal. As already stated sharing creates value is a community project in which no single individual has more power than any other single individual (except in a very few procedural situations).

The notation used is "+1", "-1" and "0".

So, what do these notations mean?

* +1   means "I agree with this and will help make it happen"
* 0    I have no strong opinion
* -1   means "I don't agree and I am offering an alternative that I am able to help implement"

The important thing is that this is not an exact science. It's just a shorthand way of communicating strength of feeling.

##### Consensus Building is Not Voting
The confusing thing about this notation is that it is the same notation used in a formal vote. Knowing when something is a vote and when it is a preference is important. It's easy to tell though, if the subject does not have "[Vote]" at the start then it's just an opinion. We try not to call votes, consensus building is much more inclusive.

The reasons for this notation being common is that when someone wants to summarise a discussion thread they can mentally add up the strength of feeling of the community and decide if there is consensus or not.

Once there is a clear consensus members of the community can proceed with the work under the [lazy consensus model](https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html).

#### Votings
##### Preparing for a Vote
Before calling a vote it is important to ensure that the community is given time to discuss the upcoming vote. This will be done by posting an email to the list indicating the intention to call a vote and the options available. By the time a vote is called there should already be consensus in the community. The vote itself is, normally, a formality.

##### Calling a Vote
Once it is time to call the vote a mail is posted with a subject starting with [VOTE]. This enables the community members to ensure they do not miss an important vote thread. It also indicates that this is not consensus building but a formal vote.
When calling a vote you need to describe the issue with no ambiguity and in a positive sense. Define the date and time for the end of the vote period.

Votes are expressed by replying email using the voting symbols defined above. Voters can change their vote during the timeframe. At the end of the vote period, the instigator tallies the number of final votes and reports the results.

##### Casting Your Vote
The notation used in voting is:

* +1   Yes I agree
* 0    I have no strong opinion
* -1   I object on the following grounds

If you object you must support your objection and provide an alternative course of action that you are willing and able to implement (where appropriate).
