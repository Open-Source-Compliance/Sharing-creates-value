# Code of Conduct

## Introduction
We expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in sharing creates value formally or informally in any role.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate escalation, please see below.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. 

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:

1.  Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a
    real-time medium.
2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with
    background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
3.  If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to
    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.

## Reporting Violations

Violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported to the owner of this repository (ofendt@googlemail.com). All complaints will be reviewed, investigated and will be determined whether the Code of Conduct was violated. In case the Code of Conduct was violated we will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a written warning or expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces. We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your conflict via the conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.

Violations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those unrelated to the project. We will only consider complaints have occurred within one year of the report.


## Enforcement

If the owner of this repository receives a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, he will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The owner of this repository will do his utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the owner of the repository may issue sanctions without notice.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
