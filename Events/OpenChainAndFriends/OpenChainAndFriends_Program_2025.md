## From Complexity to Clarity: Understanding your Software Product Health
<sub>[go to schedule](#c2t27)</sub>

### Abstract:

In this talk we will first give an overview of the challenges in assessing and communicating the current state of a software product to different stakeholder. Therefore, we introduce the term of software product health, an aggregation of information about a product’s security, quality, sustainability, and compliance. Afterwards, we show how we have built the Software Product Health Assistant (SPHA) as an open-source tool to automatically assess a product’s health score and communicate it effectively to decision-makers while enabling developers to act upon the score.

## Software Heritage - What a graph can tell your supply-chain about your software
<sub>[go to schedule](#c1t20)</sub>

### Abstract:

This talk will provide an overview of what is the Software Heritage. We will highlight the data we collect and how we do that. It includes source code and all the events we can see from the development process but also various metadata that we can use to enrich the knowledge we have on source code. We will then see how these information can be used to gain knowledge about your own source code, for instance to see if your code is already known which could mean a data leak or an usage of open source code in your applications. We will then present some perspectives about current projects to add information to the archive about vulnerabilities and how this could help to detect them in your software supply chain.

### Bio:

Thomas Aynaud joined the Software Heritage team in January 2025 as CTO. Software Heritage is a non profit organization which aims to collect, preserve, and share all software that is publicly available in source code form.

## Taming the SBOM Chaos: Using AI Agents for Audit SBOMs for OSS Compliance
<sub>[go to schedule](#c2t08)</sub>

### Abstract:
As Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) adoption grows, so does the complexity of managing, validating, and ensuring compliance with evolving regulatory frameworks. Many companies struggle with these challenges due to a lack of specialized in-house Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). This talk explores how AI-powered workflows, leveraging specialized models, can streamline compliance and audits. Attendees will gain insights into how AI agents can assist in automating SBOM analysis, reducing human workload, and enhancing compliance strategies in an increasingly regulated software landscape.

## REUSE - Crystal-clear licensing declaration for all use-cases
<sub>[go to schedule](#c1t17)</sub>

### Abstract:

A software project typically contains content under more than one license and from more than one copyright holder. This not only applies to Open Source projects but also to internal, proprietary projects in which Open Source parts can be mixed-in. Fortunately, with REUSE, there is a gold-standard for clarifying the licensing and copyright situation for a software project.

In this session, we will look at REUSE from a company perspective. The audience will learn why REUSE is not only useful when using third-party Open Source projects, but also for internal projects as well as for Open Source published by an organisation. The presenter will share some real cases from Deutsche Bahn and beyond in which REUSE helped immensely.

### Bio:

Max Mehl has been dedicated to Open Source for many years, in various roles and contributing from different perspectives. He deals with all aspects of Open Source at Deutsche Bahn, Europe’s largest railway operator and infrastructure owner. In this role, he supports in both using and contributing to Open Source in a professional manner. Previously, he worked for the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE), where he coordinated initiatives such as “Public Money? Public Code!” and REUSE.

## First Steps With ORT: An EEF Experience
<sub>[go to schedule](#c1t37)</sub>

### Abstract:

Once upon a time, researchers at Ericsson developed Erlang/OTP,
a programming language for the telecom industry. 39 years later,
Erlang/OTP is used by the telecom, messaging, banking, and even
game industry. Not only that, new languages were created and run
on top of the Erlang BEAM virtual machine: Elixir, now a
well-established language, and Gleam, the newest addition.

The proliferation of libraries and languages powering the BEAM
ecosystem led to the creation of the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EFF),
a foundation that caters for the BEAM ecosystem.

Today, 39 years from the creation of Erlang, it is not an easy
task to categorise and be compliant with the more than 13000 (total) files
that make up Erlang, Elixir, and Gleam. Yet, Erlang and Elixir are
OpenChain License compliant, and Gleam compliance is work in progress.

- What steps took EEF towards making sure that Erlang, Elixir, and Gleam
  comply with the different licenses and copyrights?

This presentation features the collaboration between the Erlang/OTP team (Ericsson)
and the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation (EEF), and the steps taken, and 
experience of using ORT as a crucial part of the EEF Ecosystem.

### Bio:

Kiko Fernandez-Reyes is a software engineer in the Erlang/OTP team,
building and improving the Erlang programming language at Ericsson.
Before that Kiko was a backend software engineer at Klarna. 
Kiko also has Ph.D. from Uppsala University, Sweden.

## Project OCCTET.eu - the why, what and how
<sub>[go to schedule](#c1t35)</sub>

### Abstract:

The OCCTET project (Open Source Compliance Comprehensive Tools and Resources) is an EU-funded initiative aimed at improving cybersecurity and compliance with the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The project focuses on creating an open-source toolkit to automate the compliance process for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) used in digital products.

## Building open source management and SBOM process for embedded software - learn from Yocto Project
<sub>[go to schedule](#c1t25)</sub>

### Abstract:
The Yocto Project is probably the most widespread approach to creating customized Linux distributions. Its strong focus on reproducibility from source inherently enable it to create Software Bills Of Material (SBOMs) with extremely high accuracy and granularity, even making it a driving force in creating and evaluating SPDX 3.0 in the context of a real application. 

This presentation takes a quick tour through Yocto, what it does and does not do, and based upon that which features it offers for SBOM creation. 

But just creating SBOMs is not enough. The challenge we see is: what to do with them? How to actually evaluate them? Lets discuss how we can move forwards here.
