As a < WHO >, I want connect < TOOL A > to < TOOL B > because < WHY >
- How do you find good practices (blueprints) that address your needs?
- How to fit existing good practices in your development setup?

- For mapping the users for further processing, the following structure was used: https://eclipse-apoapsis.github.io/guidance/docs/part_B_software_management/

In the pictures the cards have to be interpreted accordingly
- on top => Supply Chain View
- Portfolio Level
- Product/Service Level
- on bottom => Software Development

Summary of the workshop

- map existing blueprints to the user stories/structure

Group 1:
![Blueprints Group 1](blueprints_group1.jfif)

Group 2:
![Blueprints Group 2](blueprints_group2.jfif)

Next step:
- incorporation of the results in https://eclipse-apoapsis.github.io/guidance/docs/part_B_software_management/
