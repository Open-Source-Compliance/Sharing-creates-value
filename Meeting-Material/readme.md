# Guide for meeting chairs
This guide is meant to help to keep the effort as low as possible for the meeting chair while keeping the documentation as accurate as possible at the same time.

## Before the Meeting 
1. create a preparation branch "meeting_yyyymmdd" with yyyymmdd the date of the next meeting
2. in the branch create a new file in a respective subfolder /Meeting-yyyymmdd/yyyymmdd.md
3. you can use the following file [tbd] as template for the content of the new .md meeting log
4. Check the mailing list for topics relevant for the meeting - potentially request topics by sending a mail to the list (may also serve as reminder)
5. Prepare the standard content including the agenda
6. Prepare a web-conference system (ideally BigBlueButton https://conf.fsfe.org/b/compliance-tooling see hints below)
7. (optional) Check the OpenChain Global Calendar if the meeting details are correctly presented there and if necessary contact him for update
8. Create a meeting invitation including the agenda and send it to the mailing list 

## While the Meeting 
1. Start the meeting in the respective meeting tool (ideally Big Blue Button)
2. (optional) Ask / inform all participants for consent for recording and turn the cameras off. Start recording
3. Show the Antitrust slide from OpenChain and inform about the Antitrust requirements (e.g. "Stick to the shared agenda", ...). 
4. Take notes in the yyyymmdd.md in the branch set up above in "2."
5. Collect all participant names in the notes.
6. commit the file

## After the Meeting 
1. Ask presenters to provide their shown slides (either link or as PDF)
2. (optional) store the slides in the folder /Meeting-yyyymmdd/
3. add the link to the slides in the yyyymmdd.md
4. Finish the notes in yyyymmdd.md and create PR


## Hints about BigBlueButton
The BigBlueButton is provided to us by the FSFE.
You can enter the room at any time, but for further features (sharing slides, recording,...) you need to have at least one room owner with special role that can either use the functionality or assign it to other participant (e.g. screen sharing)

If this cannot be guaranteed please check for alternative conference systems (e.g. MS Teams or whatever you can use in your organization)
