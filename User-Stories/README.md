## User Stories
This directory contains the user stories of all different users and their roles interacting with the functional blocks of the compliance toolchain

## Structure
For each user/role a dedicated directory exists. It serves as a bucket for all user stories of that particular role. Further each directory contains also one epic of the user interacting with the functional blocks, which can be seen as an input to derive more detailed user stories.

## Roles & Users
Positions and titles are manifold across different companies. Thus it will be difficult to describe all potential users of such a solution. To cope with this, we suggest to describe typical roles and map them to potential job descriptions. This will allow to remain with a few roles but cover all kind of flows between the different roles.

We suggest a role model with three roles interacting hirarchically as two encapsulated principal-agent models: A normative principal (Compliance Manager) that tasks several tactical systems (POs/PMs) which by themselves act as principals in relation to a group of operative systems (Developer).
