## Introduction

Open source software has eaten the world, but organizations are still struggling with effective compliance. Open source software is heterogenous and re-used, which, while positive for software development, creates a challenge for compliance. Compliance requires multiple tools and these should be ideally combined into a workflow that supports a number of business and developer requirements. One of the requirements is ease of use in a modern development environment where code development cycles are getting ever shorter and new development results are pushed to operations ever faster. For this to work, open source compliance tools likely need to integrate with development tooling.

In the following report some of these tools are listed with information of their main license, website and a summary of their features, based on accounts by the projects. The report has been crafted to map out the wide range of open source tools that one might use to help keep their open source software compliant. However, this report, ever so comprehensive, is not exhaustive. The report includes FOSS tools as well as a few commercial tools. It also has a section for Open Source Initiatives and Development Environments, as these are  also important on a way towards automated open compliance with open tooling and open data. 

This report will be complemented based on an ecosystem survey and on practical testing of the most popular open source tools.

This report is part of the first work package in the Double Open project. See [doubleopen.org](https://doubleopen.org) for more details.

A light-weight app to audit and inventory large codebases for open source license compliance.<br>
OpossumUI was developed with the goal to build a tool for managing and combining open source compliance data from different sources. While existing analysis tools for software compliance can provide good information, using multiple of such tools often leads to huge amounts of data due to an increased detection rate. Even though the results can be merged and noise can be filtered through automatic tools, final manual revisions are often necessary. So, OpossumUI was born: A light-weight app for review of compliance information for large codebases.

* discover open source software used in applications.
* review licenses.
* generate reports from an open source code scan.

2. It then executes scripts from the "command library" in a chroot environment to collect information about packages installed in that layer
3. With that information as a base, it continues to iterate over step 1 and 2 for the rest of the layers in the container image
4. Once done, it generates a report in different formats. The default report is a verbose explanation of what layers brought in what software components. If a Dockerfile is provided then it will also provide what lines in the Dockerfile was used to create the layers.
