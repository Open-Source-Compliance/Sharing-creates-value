## Structure
For each user/role an epic exists. It illustrates how the user interacts with the functional blocks of the tool chain. The epic can be seen as an input to derive more detailed user stories.

## Roles & Users
Positions and titles are manifold across different organisations. Thus it will be difficult to describe all potential users of such a solution. To cope with this, we suggest to describe typical roles and map them to potential job descriptions. This will allow to remain with a few roles but cover all kind of flows between the different roles.

We suggest a role model with three roles interacting hirarchically as two encapsulated principal-agent models: A normative principal (Compliance Manager) that tasks several tactical systems (POs/PMs) which by themselves act as principals in relation to a group of operative systems (Developer).
